This Python program is a very simple scraper for email addresses and phone numbers. 
The re module is used to create regular expressions for phone numbers and email addresses.
The pyperclip module is used to access content which has been copied by the user to the computer's clipboard.
The detected email addresses and phone numbers will be written to a .txt file and saved to your system.

Use the following steps for utilizing this tool.

1. Navigate to the desired document/page you want to search and use CTRL + A and CTRL + C to copy its contents to your computer's clipboard.
2. Navigate to where you have the phone_and_email_scraper.py document stored.
3. Run phone_and_email_scraper.py. This will show the detected phone numbers and email addresses in the terminal.
4. The program will save the detected phone numbers and email addresses to a .txt document titled results.txt.
